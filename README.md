# Live cloud maps üåç

This project provides free, near real-time, high resolution cloud maps of the whole Earth. You can use them for whatever you like, including 3D modelling in software like Blender or Xplanet, or in 2D graphics.

Here's the latest image:

**TL;DR: If you need a high-res greyscale almost-live cloud map, use this URL:**

Other formats and resolutions are shown below.

## Frequency & availability
Images are updated eight times a day, every three hours, and pushed to `clouds.matteason.co.uk`. If you configure your software to
use `https://clouds.matteason.co.uk/images/[RESOLUTION]/[FILENAME]` you'll always stay up-to-date.

[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is enabled, so you can use the latest daily images directly in JavaScript - for example, in a [three.js TextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader).

I can't guarantee the freshness or quality of images; source data may not be available, or may be temporarily degraded.

## Available images

The following images are created every three hours. All images are available in four resolutions: 8192x4096, 4096x2048, 2048x1024 or 1024x512.

The images shown are the latest images available.

![A flat map of Earth at night with clouds obscuring the lights usually visible in populated areas](https://clouds.matteason.co.uk/images/1024x512/earth-night.jpg)

The cloud map overlaid on NASA's
[Earth at Night](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/NightLights)
image. You can combine this with the day image using some fancy shader magic to create day/night transitions:

### Specular map: `specular.jpg`

![A flat map of Earth with clouds and the Earth's surface in black and the sea in white](https://clouds.matteason.co.uk/images/1024x512/specular.jpg)

You can use this specular map to make your model more realistic by only showing specular highlights on bodies of water:

## Limitations
The generated images have some limitations due to the source data.

### Poles
The satellites do not capture the polar regions. To compensate for this, the top and bottom of the image are mirrored to cover the gap. These regions aren't very visible on 3D images anyway, and most of the area is covered by the ice caps which makes the clouds even less visible.

### Holes
Occasionally, the satellites capturing the source data will miss some regions. These areas will appear as square-ish
holes without clouds.
